# VisualP

Visual Programming Language with GPU acceleration by Microsoft's WPF. Made with love with `VB.net`

## What is done

- Fast GPU accelerated Graphical UI
- Save and Load files
- Variables
- Modular components
- Node connections and Navigation

## To-do

the following is a to-do list of things from the top of my head that still need to be implemented before considering this project a functional programming language:

- Read the node tree and generate the code
- compile the code to machine language
- linting and debugger

## WARNING: Unfinished project

This was a group project on my engineering class and is only partially done, it is not supported and I do not plan to keep developing it.

Use this project as a base for your own node-based graphical interface or open a PR and expand this. If you're making a lot of modifications, I'll make you a repo owner to make things easier.

## Running

Download the latest `visualP.zip` from the _releases_ tab and execute the setup.exe

## Coding

### Edit and compile

If you want to contribute or compile and run from the code:

- download the latest visual studio from microsoft
- install Visual Studio with .net and VB support
- clone this repo
- Open the `VisualP.sln` file
- Do your thing.

### Publishing

Use the publishing tool from visual studio to generate the package, zip it then publish

## Contribute!

You can open issues if you want to, but I do not plan fix anything on this code; That said, Please **do open PR's** at your heart's content!
